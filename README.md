# ðŸ¦‰ Bubo Reader (Fork)

Bubo Reader is a somewhat irrationally minimalist <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> and <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> feed reader you can deploy on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) in a few steps or [Glitch](https://glitch.com) in even fewer steps! The goal of the project is to generate a webpage that shows a list of links from a collection of feeds organized by category and website. That's it.

It is named after this [silly robot owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYSeCfo9-NI) from Clash of the Titans (1981).

You can read more about how this project came about in my blog post '[Introducing Bubo RSS: An Absurdly Minimalist RSS Feed Reader](https://george.mand.is/2019/11/introducing-bubo-rss-an-absurdly-minimalist-rss-feed-reader/)'

## Getting Started

How to deploy Bubo Reader in a few easy steps with Netlify or Glitch:

### Deploying to Glitch

The quickest way is to remix the project on Glitch:
[https://glitch.com/edit/#!/bubo-rss](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/bubo-rss)

Just changed some feeds in `./src/feeds.json` file and you're set! If you'd like to modify the style or the template you can changed `./output/style.css` file or the `./src/template.html` file respectively.

There is also a special `glitch` branch you can clone if you prefer:
[https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss/tree/glitch](https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss/tree/glitch)

The only difference between this branch and `master` is that it spins up a server using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve your `./output/index.html` file on Glitch. Everything else is the same.

### Deploying to Netlify

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss/fork)
- From your forked repository go to and edcit `src/feeds.json` to manage your feeds and categories
- [Create a new site](https://app.netlify.com/start) on Netlify from GitHub 

The deploy settings should automatically import from the `netlify.toml` file. All you'll need to do is confirm and you're ready to go!

### Keeping Feeds Updated

#### Using Netlify Webhooks

To keep your feeds up to date you'll want to [setup a Build Hook](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks/#incoming-webhooks) for your Netlify site and use another service to ping it every so often to trigger a rebuild. I'd suggest looking into:

- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
- [EasyCron](https://www.easycron.com/)

If you already have a server running Linux and some command-line experience it might be simpler to setup a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). 

#### Using GitHub Actions

This approach is a little different and requires some modifications to the repository. Netlify started billing for [build minutes](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/faq/) very shortly after I published this project. Running `npm build` and downloading all of the RSS feeds took up a substantial number of this minutes, particulary if you had some kind of process pinging the webhook and trigger a build every 15 minutes or so.

How is the The GitHub Action-based approach different? The same build process runs, but this time it's on GitHub's servers via the Action. It then **commits** the newly created file generated at `./output/index.html` back into the repository. Netlify still gets pinged when the repository is updated, but skips the `npm run build` step on their end, which significantly reduces the number of build minutes required.

**Short Answer**: use the [`github-action-publishing`](https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss/tree/github-action-publishing) branch for now if you'd prefer to use GitHub Actions to run your builds. 

The GitHub Action is setup to build and commit directly to the `master` branch, which is not the best practice. I'd suggest creating a separate branch to checkout and commit changes to in the Action. You could then specify that same branch as the one to checkout and publish on Netlify.

## Anatomy of Bubo Reader

- `src/index.html` - a [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template that lets you change how the feeds are displayed
- `output/style.css` - a CSS file to stylize your feed output
- `src/feeds.json` - a JSON file containing the URLs for various site's feeds separated into categories
- `src/index.js` - the script that loads the feeds and does the actual parsinga and rendering
